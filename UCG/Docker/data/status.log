2017-08-17T05:10:31.409Z Level 40 User *** dfn8 Response *** Great, based on the contents of the letter, your property coverage is replacement cost up to the agreed assessed replacement value of your house. We see from the adjuster’s notes that this should be well under that amount. You should have plenty of coverage. Any questions about your claim or coverage?

As of 2016 statistics,  at age 14, it costs on average 165,000 dollars to raise a teenager to 25, and that could be as high as 350,000 if she goes to college.
