This Directory is for WCS workspaces

When finished developing in the Watson Conversation Service tooling, Please flow the following standards
  1) Please make sure every new version has an enhancement issue with a targeted milestone
  2) Export the workspace and put through a json formatter so it contains multiple lines.
        - Any workspaces that have only one line will be deleted.
  2) Please test the workspace via all front-ends via Alexa/Google Home/SIP for Voice-only, Mobile for Voice & text, and Web Chat - Text-only
  3) Please notate any changes/dependances needed in the flow
        - document in the comment of the issue.
        - please indicate the flow commit reqiured or tie the flow and workspace via a milestone release tag
