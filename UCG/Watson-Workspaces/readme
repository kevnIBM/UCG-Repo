This Directory is for WCS workspaces

When finished developing the Watson Conversation Service, Please flow the following standards
  1) Please make sure every new version has an enhancement issue with a targeted milestone
  2) Export the workspace and put through a json formatter so it contains multiple lines.
        - Any workspaces that have only one line will be deleted.
  2) Please test the workspace via all front-ends via Alexa/Google Home/SIP for Voice only, Mobile for Voice & text, and Web Chat
  3) Please notate any changes/dependances needed in the flow
        - document in the comment of the issue.
