This Directory is for NodeRed Flows

When finished developing the Flow in NodeRed, Please flow the following standards
  1) Please make sure every new version has an enhancement issue with a targeted milestone
  2) Export the Flow formatted or put through a json formatter so it contains multiple lines.
        - Any flows that have only one line will be deleted.
  2) Please test the flows via the required front-end
  3) Please notate any changes to the front-end configuration that the flow requires
        - At the moment all front-ends have different development interfaces. Please just indicate changes via the issue comment.
