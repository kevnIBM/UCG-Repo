What is covered by basic Auto Insurance Policy,"Auto insurance premiums depend on the insured party's driving record. A record free of accidents or serious traffic violations typically results in a lower premium. Drivers with histories of accidents or serious traffic violations may pay higher premiums. Likewise, because mature drivers tend to have fewer accidents than less-experienced drivers, insurers typically charge more for drivers below age 25. If a person drives his car for work or typically drives long distances, he generally pays more for auto insurance premiums, because his increased mileage likewise increases his chances for accidents. People who do not drive as much pay less. Because of higher vandalism rates, thefts and accidents, urban drivers pay higher premiums than those living in small towns or rural areas. Other factors varying among states include the cost and frequency of litigation; medical care and repair costs; prevalence of auto insurance fraud; and weather trends.",Article,Article-What-is-covered-by-basic-Auto-Insurance-Policy,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-coverage.aspWhat is covered by basic Life Insurance Policy,"Life insurance premiums depend on the age of the insured party. Because younger people are less likely to die than older people, younger people typically pay lower life insurance costs. Gender plays a similar role. Because women tend to live longer than men, women tend to pay lower premiums. Engaging in risky activities increases insurance costs. For example, a racecar driver faces increased risk of death and, as a result, may pay high life insurance premiums or be denied coverage. A person's medical records help determine insurance rates. A history of chronic disease or other potential health issues with an individual or family, such as heart disease or cancer, may result in paying higher premiums. Obesity, alcohol consumption or smoking can affect rates as well. An applicant typically goes through a medical exam to determine whether he has high blood pressure or other signs of potential health issues that may result in premature death for the applicant and increased risk for the insurance company. People in good health typically pay lower life insurance premiums. A person pays more for insurance coverage for a longer policy term and a larger death benefit. For example, the risk of dying for a person with a 30-year policy is greater than the risk of dying for a person with a 10-year policy.",Article,Article-What-is-covered-by-basic-Life-Insurance-Policy,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-coverage.aspWHAT DOES UMBRELLA INSURANCE COVER,"Umbrella insurance is meant to help protect you from large and potentially devastating liability claims or judgments. Personal umbrella coverage comes into play when your underlying liability limits (such as from a homeowners or auto insurance policy) have been reached.",Article,Article-WHAT-DOES-UMBRELLA-INSURANCE-COVER,https://www.allstate.com/tools-and-resources/personal-umbrella-policy/whats-umbrella-insurance.aspxPERSONAL UMBRELLA INSURANCE POLICY IN ACTION,"To better understand how a personal umbrella policy works, here's an example: If you're at fault in a car accident that injures another driver, your regular automobile insurance may cover the other driver up to the limit you selected, say $250,000. But what happens if that limit is not enough to cover the other driver's resulting medical bills? If the other driver's injuries are severe, you may be legally responsible for damages beyond the $250,000 your car insurance policy covers. And, if he sues you, your personal assets could be at stake. Imagine if that injured driver were a surgeon or another highly paid professional. What if the accident you caused resulted in an injury that kept him from doing his job for six months? Suddenly, he's suing you for $1 million to cover the six months he's away from work. Your automobile policy's liability coverage may pay for up to $250,000, but where would you come up with the remaining $750,000? A personal umbrella policy can help cover the additional costs when your standard insurance policy isn't enough. An umbrella policy could provide the additional coverage you need so that you don't get stuck trying to pay the remaining balance yourself. This extra policy could help protect your bank account, home and other personal property. In most cases, personal umbrella policies are available in million-dollar increments, from $1 to $5 million. While an umbrella policy is not required, it may offer increased protection in the unfortunate event of an accident.",Article,Article-PERSONAL-UMBRELLA-INSURANCE-POLICY-IN-ACTION,https://www.allstate.com/tools-and-resources/personal-umbrella-policy/whats-umbrella-insurance.aspxWHAT IS GENERALLY NOT COVERED BY A PERSONAL UMBRELLA POLICY,"Your personal property. While personal umbrella insurance is designed to help cover expenses if you are held responsible for damages to someone else's property, that coverage typically won't apply if you cause damage to your own property. Suppose your bathtub overflows, destroying drywall in your home. Your own damages would be excluded from coverage. But if the overflow destroys the property of your downstairs neighbor, your personal umbrella insurance may cover the damages caused by your negligence, preventing you from paying out of pocket for the loss. It's important to note, though, that any umbrella insurance benefits would kick in only after the underlying policy limits have been exhausted.  Business losses - Losses related to the operation of your business or damage to your business property would generally not be covered by a personal umbrella policy, says the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The exclusion applies even if the business is home-based. For example, if you earn money providing day care in your home, any liabilities that result from that arrangement would likely not be covered.  Personal umbrella insurance typically doesn't cover other business-related liabilities such as a malpractice lawsuit, or losses in connection with your paid position as an officer or member of a governing board of a for-profit organization.  Criminal or intentional actions - A personal umbrella policy usually won't protect you from the consequences of your own intentionally harmful or illegal behavior; for example, restitution you owe if you are convicted of a crime or damages you intended to cause through your actions.  Contracts - Personal umbrella insurance typically won't protect you from any liability that arises in connection with an oral or written contract you've entered. So if you find yourself facing a lawsuit from someone you've hired to work on your home, for example, it's unlikely that your umbrella insurance would provide protection. A local agent can answer questions about personal umbrella policies so you can decide whether having additional liability coverage makes sense for you.",Article,Article-WHAT-IS-GENERALLY-NOT-COVERED-BY-A-PERSONAL-UMBRELLA-POLICY?,https://www.allstate.com/tools-and-resources/personal-umbrella-policy/whats-umbrella-insurance.aspx
