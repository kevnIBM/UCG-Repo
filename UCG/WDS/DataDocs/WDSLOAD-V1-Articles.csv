A record free of accidents or serious traffic violations typically results in a lower premium. Drivers with histories of accidents or serious traffic violations may pay higher premiums. Likewise, because mature drivers tend to have fewer accidents than less-experienced drivers, insurers typically charge more for drivers below age 25. If a person drives his car for work or typically drives long distances, he generally pays more for auto insurance premiums, because his increased mileage likewise increases his chances for accidents. People who do not drive as much pay less. Because of higher vandalism rates, thefts and accidents, urban drivers pay higher premiums than those living in small towns or rural areas. Other factors varying among states include the cost and frequency of litigation; medical care and repair costs; prevalence of auto insurance fraud; and weather trends.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-coverage.asp,,Article,What-is-covered-by-basic-Auto-Insurance-PolicyWhat is covered by basic Life Insurance Policy,"Life insurance premiums depend on the age of the insured party. Because younger people are less likely to die than older people, younger people typically pay lower life insurance costs. Gender plays a similar role. Because women tend to live longer than men, women tend to pay lower premiums. Engaging in risky activities increases insurance costs. For example, a racecar driver faces increased risk of death and, as a result, may pay high life insurance premiums or be denied coverage. A person's medical records help determine insurance rates. A history of chronic disease or other potential health issues with an individual or family, such as heart disease or cancer, may result in paying higher premiums. Obesity, alcohol consumption or smoking can affect rates as well. An applicant typically goes through a medical exam to determine whether he has high blood pressure or other signs of potential health issues that may result in premature death for the applicant and increased risk for the insurance company. People in good health typically pay lower life insurance premiums. A person pays more for insurance coverage for a longer policy term and a larger death benefit. For example, the risk of dying for a person with a 30-year policy is greater than the risk of dying for a person with a 10-year policy.",https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurance-coverage.asp,,Article,What-is-covered-by-basic-Life-Insurance-PolicyWHAT DOES UMBRELLA INSURANCE COVER,Umbrella insurance is meant to help protect you from large and potentially devastating liability claims or judgments. Personal umbrella coverage comes into play when your underlying liability limits (such as from a homeowners or auto insurance policy) have been reached.,https://www.allstate.com/tools-and-resources/personal-umbrella-policy/whats-umbrella-insurance.aspx,,Article,WHAT-DOES-UMBRELLA-INSURANCE-COVERPERSONAL UMBRELLA INSURANCE POLICY IN ACTION,"""To better understand how a personal umbrella policy works, here's an example: If you're at fault in a car accident that injures another driver, your regular automobile insurance may cover the other driver up to the limit you selected, say $250,000. But what happens if that limit is not enough to cover the other driver's resulting medical bills?If the other driver's injuries are severe, you may be legally responsible for damages beyond the $250,000 your car insurance policy covers. And, if he sues you, your personal assets could be at stake. Imagine if that injured driver were a surgeon or another highly paid professional. What if the accident you caused resulted in an injury that kept him from doing his job for six months? Suddenly, he's suing you for $1 million to cover the six months he's away from work.Your automobile policy's liability coverage may pay for up to $250,000, but where would you come up with the remaining $750,000? A personal umbrella policy can help cover the additional costs when your standard insurance policy isn't enough. An umbrella policy could provide the additional coverage you need so that you don't get stuck trying to pay the remaining balance yourself. This extra policy could help protect your bank account, home and other personal property.In most cases, personal umbrella policies are available in million-dollar increments, from $1 to $5 million. While an umbrella policy is not required, it may offer increased protection in the unfortunate event of an accident.""",https://www.allstate.com/tools-and-resources/personal-umbrella-policy/whats-umbrella-insurance.aspx,,Article,PERSONAL-UMBRELLA-INSURANCE-POLICY-IN-ACTIONWHAT IS GENERALLY NOT COVERED BY A PERSONAL UMBRELLA POLICY?,"""Your personal property. While personal umbrella insurance is designed to help cover expenses if you are held responsible for damages to someone else's property, that coverage typically won't apply if you cause damage to your own property. Suppose your bathtub overflows, destroying drywall in your home. Your own damages would be excluded from coverage. But if the overflow destroys the property of your downstairs neighbor, your personal umbrella insurance may cover the damages caused by your negligence, preventing you from paying out of pocket for the loss. It's important to note, though, that any umbrella insurance benefits would kick in only after the underlying policy limits have been exhausted.Business losses. Losses related to the operation of your business or damage to your business property would generally not be covered by a personal umbrella policy, says the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The exclusion applies even if the business is home-based. For example, if you earn money providing day care in your home, any liabilities that result from that arrangement would likely not be covered.Personal umbrella insurance typically doesn't cover other business-related liabilities such as a malpractice lawsuit, or losses in connection with your paid position as an officer or member of a governing board of a for-profit organization.Criminal or intentional actions. A personal umbrella policy usually won't protect you from the consequences of your own intentionally harmful or illegal behavior; for example, restitution you owe if you are convicted of a crime or damages you intended to cause through your actions.Contracts. Personal umbrella insurance typically won't protect you from any liability that arises in connection with an oral or written contract you've entered. So if you find yourself facing a lawsuit from someone you've hired to work on your home, for example, it's unlikely that your umbrella insurance would provide protection.A local agent can answer questions about personal umbrella policies so you can decide whether having additional liability coverage makes sense for you.""",https://www.allstate.com/tools-and-resources/personal-umbrella-policy/whats-umbrella-insurance.aspx,,Article,WHAT-IS-GENERALLY-NOT-COVERED-BY-A-PERSONAL-UMBRELLA-POLICY?Credit Card Stolen? Here's What You Do,"Despite high-profile media attention, the odds of having your credit or debit card number stolen by crooks remains at historically low levels. That said, it’s always good to know what to do in case lightening does strike and someone fraudulently uses your card. Left unchecked, they might try to run up bills, drain your checking account or worse — steal your identity. Here are actions to take if this happens to you, as well as preventive measures that can lessen your risk going forward: Call the card issuer. First, contact the bank or credit union that issued your card. You’ll find a toll-free number on the back of your card, on your billing statement or at the company’s website. The issuer will closely monitor your account for odd behavior and may either reissue a card with a new CVV (card verification code) number or issue an entirely new card number. Be sure to change any related passwords or PIN numbers and notify companies that have automatic payments tied to the account to make sure you don’t miss a payment. Also keep a log of all calls, letters and emails you have with your card issuer about the fraud — this will be helpful if you need to file a claim or police report.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-alderman/credit-card-theft_b_1163252.html,,Article,Credit-Card-Stolen?-Heres-What-You-DoContact credit bureaus if are a victim of identity theft,"Contact one of the three major credit bureaus, Equifax (888-766-0008), Experian (888-397-3742) or TransUnion (800-680-7289), and place an Initial Fraud Alert on your credit file for 90 days if you suspect you have been, or are about to be, a victim of identity theft. Whichever bureau you contact will notify the other two to do the same. If you wish, you can renew these fraud alerts each quarter, free of charge. If you determine that you actually have suffered identity theft, you can also file an Extended Fraud Alert, which will stay on your reports for seven years. To do so, you’ll need to submit an Identity Theft Report, as outlined below. Placing a fraud alert entitles you to one free credit report from each bureau. Although the alert makes it harder for someone to open new credit accounts in your name, it won’t necessarily prevent them from using existing accounts. That’s why it’s important to close compromised accounts and to carefully review your credit reports for errors, fraudulent activity or suspicious credit inquiries from an unfamiliar source. Just be aware that posting a fraud alert could delay your own ability to obtain new credit. You might want to order new credit reports every month or two for the next year or so as a precaution. Also, remember that by law, you can order one free credit report a year from each bureau through the government-authorized AnnualCreditReport.com, whether or not you suspect fraud.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-alderman/credit-card-theft_b_1163252.html,,Article,Contact-credit-bureaus-if-are-a-victim-of-identity-theft"File theft report, if someone has stolen your credit card","If you determine that someone has indeed stolen from your account or that you are otherwise the victim of identity theft (i.e., they used your information to open new accounts, etc.), you’ll need to file a detailed Identity Theft Report with the police. The Federal Trade Commission’s Recover From Identity Theft site contains step-by-step instructions for completing and filing the report with local, state and federal law-enforcement agencies. You’ll also need to send copies of the report — by certified mail, return requested — to the credit bureaus and companies whose accounts were impacted. They then have 15 days to request further information or documentation to help verify the theft. You can also file a complaint with the FTC, which will enter the information into a secure online database shared by thousands of civil and criminal law-enforcement authorities worldwide. ",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-alderman/credit-card-theft_b_1163252.html,,Article,File-theft-report-if-someone-has-stolen-your-credit-cardPreventive measures to take against Fraud,"Going forward, carefully monitor your monthly credit card and bank statements for fraudulent charges. In fact, get in the habit of checking your statements online every few days. Sometimes thieves who’ve gained access to account information will slip in a minor purchase to see if you’re paying attention. Other good habits include: Make sure your anti-virus and anti-spyware software is current and use only secure websites. Never provide personal information by mail, phone or email unless you initiated the communication. Create strong, randomly patterned passwords and change them regularly. Shield keypads from the eyes of “shoulder surfers” at stores and ATMs. Review receipts for accuracy before signing and retain them for your records. Shred paperwork and receipts containing personal or account information once they’re no longer needed.

In addition, many credit card networks provide “zero liability” protection if you promptly report the loss. Liability for debit card losses is slightly different. Debit card transactions that you signed for (called “offline” transactions) typically are protected by “zero liability” policies similar to those for credit cards. If you report the loss within two business days, your maximum liability is $50 — although most banks and credit unions will waive this fee. That limit rises to $500 after two days; and if you don’t notify your financial institution within 60 days of receiving a statement showing unauthorized transactions, you could be liable for the entire amount — although most financial institutions limit your liability to $50. Be aware that some types of PIN-based transactions, where you enter your PIN at the retailer’s kiosk or an ATM instead of signing a receipt, may be excluded from your card-issuer’s zero-liability coverage, depending on which PIN debit network is used to complete the transaction. Ask your bank or credit union about its policy for both types of debit card transactions.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-alderman/credit-card-theft_b_1163252.html,,Article,Financial-liability-due-to-stolen-credit-cardsHOW DOES AN ARM WORK,"""This will make a lot more sense when we examine the 5-year ARM loan. This is actually the most popular type of adjustable-rate mortgage in use today. There are other variations, such as the 1-year and the 7/1 adjustable. But here we will focus on the 5-year version in particular. You might also see it referred to as the 5/1 ARM loan, and you’ll understand why in just a moment.The 5/1 ARM loan starts off with a fixed interest rate for the first five years. This is where the number 5 comes from in the designation. After the initial fixed-rate period, the interest rate will begin to adjust annually (every year). That’s what the number 1 means in the designation — it means the rate will adjust every year after the initial phase. ",http://www.homebuyinginstitute.com/mortgage/5-year-arm-115/,,Article,HOW-DOES-AN-ARM-WORK
